# KLC
[Kismet](https://github.com/kismetwireless/kismet) Log Consolidator for 802.11 Wi-Fi wardriving

This works differently than the klc.pl included with [KLV](http://www.mindflip.org/klv/) as it consolidates and merges data from multiple Kismet outputs

# History
2005 - I foolishly released this into the wild on a server running in my bedroom, and it was nearly lost forever.

2006 - Dutch enhanced the performance of my poor code, thank you.

2021 - Is this the latest file floating around in the community? Is it even still used!?
